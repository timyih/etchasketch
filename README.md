# etchasketch
A sketchpad made using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

9/20
Finished the etch-a-sketch to the specifications of the project. Forgot to add initial thoughts but it's fine. This project took a couple hours but wasn't too bad. With the help of google and stack overflow, many problems were solved. Unfortunately that can't be done on most coding interviews so that's gonna suck, but I will learn and practice more until I have this knowledge ingrained in my brain. Fun project.
